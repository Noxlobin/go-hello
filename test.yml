# This is a YAML file
# If you dont know YAML, you should check out https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
# However, this is my version of YAML. Still, I reccommend you read that article.

# No dashes are required! Yay :)
# Everything needs a value, cause thats how configuration works.
# Single quotes for keys, double for values.
'foo': "bar"
'fizz': "fuzz"

# Numbers are numbers. They don't change. Buuut I don't like floating points, so I skip.
'lucky_number': 42

# It's hard to implement booleans. Use 't' and 'f' instead.
'broccolies_are_good': f
'i_love_dogs': t

# Make a list using []. Separate using commas.
'foods': ["Pies", "Cupcakes", "Pizza", "Drumsticks"]

# Thats all. The features I didn't implement (like dictionaries) are because i'm too lazy to do it.
